Thinkful dev prep project regarding jQuery.

Aim: to create an interactive web page to learn various jQuery methods and get a better feel for DOM traversal and manipulation.

Version Control Aside: I've embedded this repo within another 'uber-repo' of mine (DEV-301-PREP). Apparently GitHub identifies this repo (jquery-streetfighter) as a 'submodule': https://github.com/artificialarea/DEV-301-PREP/commit/28ce383449486f67b45ce2b500600e62cafbc2e1

Not sure if it's kosher to have a .git within another .git? Probably not, but I shall see...

StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10360342/git-clone-into-another-existing-git-repo

"... you can clone a git repo within another one: Everything under your submodule directory will be ignored by the enclosing Git repo, because said submodule directory contains a .git."
